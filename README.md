# HV-Power-Supply-Weight-Optimization
This is a script modified from the 2020 thesis by Yiou He: "Towards High Voltage Power Conversion", that has been modified for readability and easier data importing, as well as taking into account Volume, fixing some issues with winding patterns and consistency across driver scripts, and more to come. The content was parsed with OCR from the original thesis PDF and then manually checked to remove errors. Comments were added to explain functions of much of the code that I deemed confusing.
